Project Overview
This project utilizes a dataset of used car listings to train a machine learning model that predicts car prices. The primary focus is on feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook detailing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process.

Features
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing steps to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical data.
Feature Engineering: Techniques to create meaningful features from raw data.
Model Selection: Comparison of multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation Metrics: Use of metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python and several libraries installed. The easiest way to set up your environment is by using the provided requirements.txt file.

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset: The dataset can be downloaded from this link and placed in the data/ directory.

Usage
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Open notebooks/Data_Exploration.ipynb to explore and preprocess the data.

Model Training: Use notebooks/Model_Training.ipynb to train and evaluate different regression models.

Prediction: After training, you can use the script predict.py to make predictions on new car listings.

Results
The model performance is evaluated in the Jupyter Notebooks. Key results and insights are summarized in results.md. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.
